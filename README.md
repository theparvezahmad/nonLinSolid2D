Development of a finite-element solver for dynamic geometrically-nonlinear large
deformation problems with non-uniform stiffness.
A finite-element solver valid for dynamic large displacement.
Geometric nonlinearity is considered in the formulation.
Finds application in robotics, flapping flight and computer animation.
Total Lagrangian formulation used for description of the motion.
Structure modelled as 2D solid continua having 2 DOFs.
Dynamics of non-uniform stiffness is incorporated.
